# Mint-X-Hacks

This is a copy of Mint-X, one of the built-in desktop themes for Linux Mint.
It includes some changes I've made to learn how to create themes.

The original code (among other things) is here: https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes

Note: I'm not affiliated with Linux Mint, I just use their software.
